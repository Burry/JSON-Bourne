### Project Plan
Our project’s development will be segmented into four sprint cycles. The first sprint includes standing up a barebones Node.js application, implementing some basic styling and UI paradigms, designing the schemas for our two databases, and developing a script to scrape recipe information from a website. Our second sprint will involve integrating our databases into the application, implementing sample data, building a user login and registration system, implementing basic recipe search, building out front-end views, integrating the scraper with the application, and the introduction of unit tests. Sprint 3 includes expanding search functionality through advanced filters and ranking, including nutritional information into the database, recipe views, and search filters, building the ability for users to create and submit custom recipes, offering the ability to substitute ingredients per a user’s preferences or a one-time selection, and further unit testing. The fourth and final sprint will involve building the functionality to offer a shopping list for any given recipe, tracking a user’s inventory of purchased ingredients, and user acceptance tests.

### Agile Standup Meeting Summary
During our standup meeting, each of our group members discussed their progress on assigned tasks, encountered challenges, and next steps. We as a whole feel good about our progress so far but are aware of several challenges to be mindful of to stay on schedule. Austin and Jake worked on designing the databases and formulated schemas for both based on found sample databases with similar structures. Their biggest challenge has been trying to foresee our project’s future needs so that we don’t have to go back and change the schema designs. Yongbo worked on the application’s UX design, designed a web page mockup, and researched user-application interaction paradigms. Gabe developed a Python script to scrape an extensive amount of recipe information from a website for saving and eventually for ingestion into a database. A few notable challenges encountered include scraping time, a consistent Python environment, and counteracting techniques sites employ to evade web scrapers. Grant created a Node.js application scaffold with an HTTP server, a few front-end views, and these views’ necessary routing procedures, and he ran into a challenge of ensuring the development process was generalized such that environment would not be a factor.

### Agile Retrospective Meeting Summary

What we did well:

- Rapid progress
- A basic skeleton of web page
- Initial scraping programs have produced many recipes
- Everyone is using the same development tools


What can be improved:

- Consistent development environment
- More frequent progress updates amongst team
- Finishing web page css style
- Optimizing disabled-friendly settings

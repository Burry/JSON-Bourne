### Database Software
We are using PostgreSQL for user data and data related to users, and we are using MongoDB for recipes, ingredients, and tags. Sequelize and Mongoose handle object modeling for each database.

### Database Creation and Population
The scripts to design models, create tables/collections, and populate objects are found in the project's [/models](https://github.com/Burry/JSON-Bourne/tree/master/models) directory.
